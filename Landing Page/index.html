                <div class="col-md-6"><h3 class="centerMe">Fashion</h3><p class="pillarPar">Raised in both Paris and Montreal, it is no surprise that these different experiences would inspire 24 year old Mark Stockton to create music thatâ€™s genre bending. Mark mixes in pop, hip-hop and neo-soul to create a sound that is timeless, reminiscent of the past but most importantly his goal is to take you on a cinematic journey.  He believes that music shouldn't be created to fit into the moment but for years to come.

                <!--<div class="col-md-4"><h3 class="centerMe">Graphic Novels</h3><p class="pillarPar">Not entirely sure what to put here. Maybe another small anecdote about why he is interested in them and what sort of genre to expect from him.</p></div>-->
